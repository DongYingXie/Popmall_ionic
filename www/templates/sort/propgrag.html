Radio buttons act no differently as standard radio input elements. Following this convention will display a list of radio buttons similarly seen in modern app.

Each item-radio must have a radio input with the same input name attribute. The radio-icon class is used to designate when to show and hide the icon element.

Ionic prefers to use the <label> element for a radio item in order to make the entire area tappable.
